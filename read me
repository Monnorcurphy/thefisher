## The Fisher

### Background

The Fisher is a duplicate of Fishing Girl by Kongregate. Fishing Girl starts out with the player having 3 small lures, a fishing rod follow and the following rules:

1) All fish are attracted to all lures.
2) The lure determines the size of the fish that can be caught. Small lures can catch small fish, medium lures catch medium fish, etc.
3) If a larger fish bites a lure of a smaller size, the lure is lost (I.e. medium fish eats a small lure, large fish eats a small/medium lure)

### Functionality & MVP

Users will be able to:

- [ ] Fish (Throw a lure, reel in a lure, catch a fish)
- [ ] Play/pause the music
- [ ] Buy different lures

In addition, this project will include:

- [ ] An About modal describing the background and rules of the game
- [ ] A production Readme

### Wireframes

This app will consist of a single screen with the game (a small island, the fisher, the fishing rod vector), directions, and nav links to the Github, add my LinkedIn.  Game controls will be holding down the mouse to select how far a lure should be thrown. The farther a lure is thrown, the deeper it will go as well. On the left, three clickable shapes will be used to purchase lures.

### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- Vanilla JavaScript and jquery for overall structure and game logic,
- Easel.js with `HTML5 Canvas` for rendering,
- Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts.

### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: Setup all modules, refresh on javascript/jquery, learn the basics of Easel.js.  Goals:

- Learn enough Easel.js to render an object to the Canvas element

**Day 2**: Dedicate this day to learning the `Easel.js` API. Goals:

- Render the ocean, island, fish, rod, and fisher

**Day 3**: Create the fish logic backend.  Handle the different fish/lure types along with their rule following logic.  Incorporate the backend logic into frontend rendering.  Goals:

- Fish are attracted to lures, fisher can reel fish in, fish of larger sizes eat smaller lures.

**Day 4**: Install the controls for the user to interact with the game.  Style the frontend, making it polished and professional.  Goals:

- Create controls throwing the lure via the fishing rod vector
- Nice design

### Bonus features
Possible bonuses include:

- [ ] An ability to change music
- [ ] More advanced lures, larger fish
- [ ] A more story driven beginning and end
- [ ] Have fishes of different commonalities (rare fish are only attracted to lures at shorter distances)
